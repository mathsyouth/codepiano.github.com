### Production-ready Docker packaging for Python developers

1. [Faster or slower: the basics of Docker build caching](https://pythonspeed.com/articles/docker-caching-model/)
   Docker’s layer caching can speed up your image build—if you write your Dockerfile correctly.
1. [Where’s your code? Debugging ImportError and ModuleNotFoundErrors in your Docker image](https://pythonspeed.com/articles/importerror-docker/)
   There are many reasons your code might fail to import in Docker. Here’s a quick series of checks you can do to figure out the problem.
1. [A tableau of crimes and misfortunes: the ever-useful docker history](https://pythonspeed.com/articles/docker-history/)
   Whether it’s understanding how a base image is constructed, figuring out why your image is too big, or understanding how Dockerfile commands work, docker history should be your go-to command.
1. [Broken by default: why you should avoid most Dockerfile examples](https://pythonspeed.com/articles/dockerizing-python-is-hard/)
   Most Dockerfile examples you’ll find on the Web are broken. And that’s a problem.
1. [Best practices for writing Dockerfiles](https://docs.docker.com/develop/develop-images/dockerfile_best-practices/)
   This document covers recommended best practices and methods for building efficient images.
1. [A review of the official Dockerfile best practices: good, bad, and insecure](https://pythonspeed.com/articles/official-docker-best-practices/)
   The official Docker documentation’s Dockerfile best practices are mostly good—but they omit some important information.
1. [The best Docker base image for your Python application (April 2020)](https://pythonspeed.com/articles/base-image-python-docker-images/)
   Ubuntu? Official Python images? Alpine Linux? Here’s how to choose a good base image.
1. [A deep dive into the official Docker image for Python](https://pythonspeed.com/articles/official-python-docker-image/)
   The official Python Docker image is useful, but to actually understand why, and to use it correctly, it’s worth understanding how exactly it’s constructed.
1. [Building on solid ground: ensuring reproducible Docker builds for Python](https://pythonspeed.com/articles/reproducible-docker-builds-python/)
   You want to be able to rebuild the same Docker image from the same source code across different computers and different points in time. Here’s how to get reproducible builds.
1. [Installing system packages in Docker with minimal bloat](https://pythonspeed.com/articles/system-packages-docker/)
   Your Docker build needs to update system packages for security, and perhaps to install them for additional dependencies. Here’s how to do it without making your image too large, on Debian, Ubuntu, CentOS and RHEL.
1. [Less capabilities, more security: minimizing privilege escalation in Docker](https://pythonspeed.com/articles/root-capabilities-docker-security/)
   To reduce the security risk from your Docker image, you should run it as a non-root user. You should also reduce it capabilities: learn what, why, and how.
1. [Faster Docker builds with pipenv, poetry, or pip-tools](https://pythonspeed.com/articles/pipenv-docker/)
   Installing dependencies separately from your code allows you to take advantage of Docker’s layer caching. Here’s how to do it with pipenv, poetry, or pip-tools.
1. [Elegantly activating a virtualenv in a Dockerfile](https://pythonspeed.com/articles/activate-virtualenv-dockerfile/)
   How to activate a virtualenv in a Dockerfile without repeating yourself—plus, you’ll learn what activating a virtualenv actually does.
1. [Multi-stage builds #1: Smaller images for compiled code](https://pythonspeed.com/articles/smaller-python-docker-images/)
   You’re building a Docker image for a Python project with compiled code (C/C++/Rust/whatever), and somehow without quite realizing it you’ve created a Docker image that is 917MB… only 1MB of which is your code!
1. [Multi-stage builds #2: Python specifics—virtualenv, –user, and other methods](https://pythonspeed.com/articles/multi-stage-docker-python/)
   Now that you understand multi-stage builds, here’s how to implement them for Python applications.
1. [Multi-stage builds #3: Why your build is surprisingly slow, and how to speed it up](https://pythonspeed.com/articles/faster-multi-stage-builds/)
   Multi-stage builds give you small images and fast builds—in theory. In practice, they require some tricks if you want your builds to actually be fast.
1. [Configuring Gunicorn for Docker](https://pythonspeed.com/articles/gunicorn-in-docker/)
   Running in a container isn’t the same as running on a virtual machine or physical server: you need to configure Gunicorn (and other servers) appropriately.
1. [Activating a Conda environment in your Dockerfile](https://pythonspeed.com/articles/activate-conda-dockerfile/)
   Learn how to activate a conda environment in your Dockerfile.
1. [Shrink your Conda Docker images with conda-pack](https://pythonspeed.com/articles/conda-docker-image-size/)
   Docker images built for Conda tend to be quite large. Learn how to shrink them by using the conda-pack tool and multi-stage builds.
1. [What’s running in production? Making your Docker images identifiable](https://pythonspeed.com/articles/identifying-images/)
   It’s difficult to debug production problems if you don’t know what image is running in production.
1. [Options for packaging your Python code: Wheels, Conda, Docker, and more](https://pythonspeed.com/articles/distributing-software/)
   There are a variety of ways of packaging your Python application for distribution, from wheels to Docker. This article gives a survey of the different approaches, specifically focusing on distributing internal server applications.
